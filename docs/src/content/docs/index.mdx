## About

Doodle Engine is a dialogue-driven engine for RPGs and narrative adventure games. It focuses on story, choices, and world state rather than movement or combat systems.

The design is inspired by classic dialogue scripting approaches used in games built on the Infinity Engine, but the engine itself is system-agnostic and intended for a wide range of narrative games.

## Extensibility

The engine core does not assume a UI or save backend. Renderers, shells, and persistence layers can be replaced or extended.

Effects and conditions are building blocks. Combine them in dialogue to create mechanics such as reputation systems, skill checks, crafting, or shops without modifying the engine.
