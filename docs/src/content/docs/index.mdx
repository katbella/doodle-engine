## What is Doodle Engine?

Inspired by the Infinity Engine, Doodle Engine is for creators who want a story-first approach to games that can be extended. Write branching dialogue, quests, and world content in YAML and a simple DSL (domain-specific language). No code required for authoring. Plug in the included React renderer or build your own UI with the framework-agnostic core.

### Who is it for?

- **Game authors** who want to write stories without coding
- **Interactive fiction writers** who need more game systems than Twine provides
- **Web developers** who want to build narrative games with familiar tools (TypeScript, React, Vite)
