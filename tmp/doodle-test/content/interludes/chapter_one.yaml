  Chapter One: A New Beginning

  The road behind you stretches long and empty.
  Ahead, the lights of town flicker through the evening mist.

  You have heard the rumours. Strange things happening.
  People going missing. Shadows that move wrong.

  Someone has to look into it.

  It might as well be you.
