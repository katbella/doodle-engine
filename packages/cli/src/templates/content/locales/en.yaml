# Narrator Intros
# ===================
narrator.tavern_intro: "You push open the heavy oak door and step inside. The warmth hits you first, then the smell — stale ale, wood smoke, and something frying in the kitchen. A few patrons hunch over their mugs. Behind the bar, a broad-shouldered man wipes down glasses, watching you with quiet interest."
narrator.market_intro: "The market square opens up before you, a riot of color and noise. Stalls line every side, draped in bright awnings. Merchants call out their prices, children dart between carts, and somewhere a street musician plays an out-of-tune fiddle."
narrator.choice.look_around: "Look around."
